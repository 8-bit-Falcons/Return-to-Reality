# Return to Reality

## Conventions to follow
- Name your branch after what you're working on. Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens. Examples: level1, level2, music-integration
- Make **draft** pull requests for every branch you make (compare your branch to main)
  - Undraft them when you are finished
- If you need to add assets for whatever reason, put them under the appropriate folders

## Other things to keep in mind
- Make sure all nodes have "Makes sure the object's children are not selectable" on
- Make sure to use a 32x32 snap grid & make collision rectangles n tilesets n stuff like that 32x32
- Make sure to reimport all assets with "2D pixel" as the preset!!
